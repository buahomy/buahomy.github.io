## My Projects:

### Political Market Volatility
This project examines stock price volatility (S&P 500, DJI, Nasdaq) during U.S. presidential elections. By analyzing closing price data from October to November, I explore how the market reacts to political uncertainty. Through percentage change calculations and color-coded visualizations (blue for Democrats, red for Republicans), I aim to uncover patterns in market behavior and assess the impact of elections on short-term stock performance.

### Melodrip: Image to Music Playlist Generator
This project focuses Image Captioning, TextRank, TF-IDF vectorization, and Cosine Similarity in order to develop an image to song playlist generator Through the project, I was able to create a list of songs recommended in order of the similarity between the generated image caption through the model BLIP-2 and the song lyrics of a million songs from Spotify. The similarity scores of the recommended songs largely reside between the 0.7 and 0.9 mark, and thus there are considerations on how the similarity scores can be improved upon for a possible version 2.
